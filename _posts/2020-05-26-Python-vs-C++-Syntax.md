Having started my programming journey with a lower-level language like C++, moving to Python should reasonably be reasonably efficient. Afterall, Python does away with the need to declare types at the outset, allowing for greater flexibility. The introduction of dictionaries also eliminated the need to create user-defined classes such as token, as i was taught in the <a href="https://cchanzl.github.io/tableau/2020/05/01/C++-Calculator-Solution">C++ Calculator Solution. </a>

However, when it comes to Python's syntax, 3 main differences stood out for me which i would summarise below. These 3 syntax differences are discussed in greater detail in the book "Learning Python, Fifth Edition" by Mark Lutz at the start of Chapter 10. This is a book that I would strongly recommend to any beginner when starting their Python journey.

<b> Parentheses are optional </b>
