The first program that really helped me to learn C++ was the <a href="https://cchanzl.github.io/tableau/2020/05/01/C++-Calculator-Solution">solution to the calculator exercise. </a> The purpose of the program would be familiar to most beginners, hence making it easy to understand. Yet, it challenges the notion of how we understand calculators work from a coding perspective. Simple issues like reading each character of input and differentiating the types and order of operations was something I took for granted.

So i thought this would be a good first task when learning Python as well, to code a similar program based on the grammar of the C++ solution. Due to the differences in syntax, particularly the use of dynamic typing in Python, a different approach is required. I elaborate further on some of the main difficulties i faced below.

<b> Lack of type sensitive input operation in Python </b>
<br>

In the C++ solution, inputs to the program are bound to a certain type due to the operation of cin. This binding allows numeric inputs to be identified as double and non-numeric inputs (such as "(" and "/") ot be identified as character type. In Python, this is achieved first by reading the inputs into a list. I then defined dictionary() to filter the inputs accordingly. For example, when "55+6;" is entered, list_expr will be assigned to {"5", "5" , "+", "6"}. Dictionary() will then iterate through the list, combining successive integers to form "55".

zip() is then used to create a dictionary of the inputs. This is the Python equivalent of the token class execution in the C++ solution, with list_keys.pop() being the get() and list_keys.append() being the putback() equivalent.

Error and exception handling have not been built into the code yet. This is definitely something I should pick up again in another post as there are many ways the code can break with different inputs at the moment. But it is working as a proof of concept.

<b> Scoping Scoping Scoping </b>
<br>

The use of the token class in C++ means that a global variable is required in the Python version as well (at this stage anyway without involving user-defined classes in Python). This takes the form of dict_expr and list_keys, both of which are fundamental in the code, being reference in expression(), term() and primary(). 

There are also multiple occassions where I used local variables, such as t, a, x and y for iteration purposes. This caused some issues in the beginning and probbaly not best practice so there is room for improvement here.

<b> Lists and Dictionaries are your best friend </b>
<br>

Understanding the syntax, expressions and methods of lists and dictionaries is crucial here. I struggled with the error "TypeError: can only assign an iterable" for one good hour before realising that X[0:2] = 1 does not work as "1" is not an iterable. X[0:2] = [1] works as s list slice must be filled by a list.
