The first program that really helped me to learn C++ was the <a href="https://cchanzl.github.io/tableau/2020/05/01/C++-Calculator-Solution">solution to the calculator exercise. </a> The purpose of the program would be familiar to most beginners, hence making it easy to understand. Yet, it challenges the notion of how we understand calculators work from a coding perspective. Simple issues like reading each character of input and differentiating the types and order of operations was something I took for granted.

So i thought this would be a good first task when learning Python as well, to code a similar program based on the grammar of the C++ solution. Due to the differences in syntax, particularly the use of dynamic typing in Python, a different approach is required. I elaborate further on some of the main difficulties i faced below.

<b> Lack of type sensitive input operation </b>

<b> Scoping Scoping Scoping </b>

<b> Lists and Dictionaries are your best friend </b>
