Having minimal previous experience with Tableau and lots of experience manipulating and collecting data, this seems to be a perfect opportunity to pick up new skills and put it to practical use. Through this, i hope to provide interesting insights and learn something through the process too. Of course, do feel free to provide feedback to how i can better present certain data!

As a start, i would present a simple visualization of the market share of general insurers in Singapore in 2016.
