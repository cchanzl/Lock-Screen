Setting up and hosting a dashboard online as i did for MAS Form 6 may look daunting at first. However, the steps required are relatively straightforward and a fair bit of patience!

<b> Initial Setup </b>
<br>
Before I jump into the steps, we would need the following installed. If you have been exploring Python and Plotly, some of these basic requirements would have already been fulfilled. Note that these does not include the required Python packages which you can find out under "requirements.txt" in a subsequent step or see in the source code.
<ol>
  <li>
    Pycharm
  </li>
  
  <li>
    Git Bash (required for pushing updates to Heroku)
  </li> 
</ol>
There are other requirements (such as Git Bash and a Heroku account) but we will get to these as we go through each step.

<b> Step 1: Deploy a sample dashboard </b>
