I have been a longtime fan of the Youtube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown"> 3Blue1Brown </a>, watching and listening to Grant Sanderson (the owner of the channel) discuss interesting mathematical topics using simple and clear animations. When I found out that these videos were made using Python with the manim package (which Grant wrote himself), an idea came to me that I can use this package to explain actuarial concepts in a similarly simple and effective manner. I can also take the opportunity to improve on Python as I plan to produce videos summarising key concepts in actuarial research papers (such as Bootstrapping) in the future. These would definitely be more involved than the video below.

For starters and to familiarise myself with the package, I made a video on Actuarial Claims Triangle. This is a rather straightforward video consisting mainly of for-loops but it gives a good introduction to the mechanics of the package and what is possible. Perhaps I should invset in a proper microphone going forward.

Enjoy...
