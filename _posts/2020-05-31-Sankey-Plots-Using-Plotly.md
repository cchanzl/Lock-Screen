In this post, i would visualise the change and breakdown of monthly expenses since i moved to London using Plotly, Python's visualisation library. The source code for this visualisation is included in the gist below. There are significant improvements to be made in the way data is treated and subsequently used in order to derive the plot.

For example, a multi-dimensional list-based array is used to transform a table in excel into the necessary inputs into the Sankey trace. Using a dataframe from the pandas library would be more efficient and easier to access the underlying values. Also, the colours and labels of the trace can be further refined to provide better information and visual cues.

However, the current diagram does serve its purpose. For example, we can see a clear reduction in expenses incurred from eating out between September and May, which is clearly due to Covid-19. A corresponding increase in amount spent on groceries is seen in the same period.

In summary, this plot is a good start to understanding the vast library of traces offered by Plotly and the level of customisation possible which i am keen to explore further.
