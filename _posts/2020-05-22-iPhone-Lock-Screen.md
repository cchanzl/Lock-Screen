So this mini-project began with the intent of updating my iphone lock screen with something interesting. Then the idea came - Why not use the opportunity to practice coding?

The idea behind the code is really simple. 

<ol>
  <li>
    <p> Read from a text file which contains the desired ASCII Art (thanks to online ASCII art generators. Links at the end) </p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <p> Check the size of the art and position it on the console with the use of vectors </p>
  </li>
 
 <li>
    Apply colour to the font and background (optional)
 </li> 
  
 <li>
    <p> Take a screenshot of the desired iphone dimension </p>
 </li>
  
</ol>
