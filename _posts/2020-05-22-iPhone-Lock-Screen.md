So this mini-project began with the intent of updating my iphone lock screen with something interesting. Then the idea came - Why not use the opportunity to practice coding?

The idea behind the code is really simple. 

<ol>
  <li>Read from a text file which contains the desired ASCII Art (thanks to online ASCII art generators. Links at the end)
  <li>Check the size of the art and position it on the console with the use of vectors
  <li>Apply colour to the font and background (optional)
  <li>Take a screenshot of the desired iphone dimension
</ol>

<p style="text-align:center">ASCII art from http://patorjk.com</p>
