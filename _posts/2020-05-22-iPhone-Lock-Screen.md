So this mini-project began with the intent of updating my iphone lock screen with something interesting. Then the idea came - Why not use the opportunity to practice coding?

The idea behind the code is really simple. 

1) Read from a text file which contains the desired ASCII Art (thanks to online ASCII art generators. Links at the end)
2) Check the size of the art and position it on the console with the use of vectors
3) Colourise the art (optional)
4) Take a screenshot of the desired iphone dimension
