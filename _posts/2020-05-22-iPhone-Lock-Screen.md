So this mini-project began with the intent of updating my iphone lock screen with something interesting. Then the idea came - Why not use the opportunity to practice coding?

The idea behind the code is really simple. 

<ol>
  <li>Read from a text file which contains the desired ASCII Art (thanks to online ASCII art generators. Links at the end)</li>
  <li>Check the size of the art and position it on the console with the use of vectors</li>
  <li>Apply colour to the font and background (optional)</li>
  <li>Take a screenshot of the desired iphone dimension</li>
</ol>
