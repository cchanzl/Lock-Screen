Following from the initial lightweight exercise of <a href="https://cchanzl.github.io/python/2020/06/02/PDF-Scraping-MAS-Form-23"> obtaining CAR information </a> of insurers in the Singpaore market, i would go one step further to employ a similar technique in scraping the complete tabl in  MAS Form 6 - Statements of Premiums, Claims and Underwriting Results for SIF.

The process is largely similar from the previous exercise, except that it is more involved as we are no longer extracting a single number which is clearly identifiable by a symbol. I will update this post with the detailed steps soon but you can see that at the end of the process, the output is a clearly delimited text file. Iterating this code across multiple insurers and reporting years, we can then build up a sizeable database upon which interesting visualisation and insights can be obtained.
