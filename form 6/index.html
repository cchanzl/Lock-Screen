<p> Footnotes  </p>
<p> 1) Historical information allows for mergers and acquisitions to the best of my knowledge. It may not reflect an accurate historical view and individual due diligence is expected when placing reliance on the data. </p>
<p> 2) All information presented above relates only to the Singapore Insurance Fund ("SIF")  </p>
<p> 3) Box plots are based on data of selected insurers and not the entire market.  </p>
